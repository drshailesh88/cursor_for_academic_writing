# Academic Writing Platform - Constitution

## Project Identity

**Name:** Academic Writing Platform
**Version:** 2.0
**Mission:** Empower researchers across all scientific disciplines to write publication-ready documents with AI assistance, multi-database research integration, and professional export capabilities.

## Core Principles

### 1. Academic Integrity First
- All AI-generated content must be transparent and editable
- Citations must be verifiable and traceable to source databases
- Never generate fabricated citations or data
- Clearly distinguish AI suggestions from user content

### 2. Discipline Agnosticism
- Support all scientific fields equally: life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities
- Adapt writing conventions, citation styles, and terminology per discipline
- No discipline should be a second-class citizen

### 3. Open & Accessible
- Multi-LLM support: users choose their AI provider
- Free tier with meaningful capabilities (11+ free models via OpenRouter)
- Self-hostable for institutional deployment
- Open-source codebase

### 4. Research Reproducibility
- All database queries are logged and reproducible
- Search parameters are transparent
- Export includes full citation metadata

### 5. User Control
- Users own their documents and data
- No AI training on user content without consent
- Easy data export and account deletion
- Transparent about AI model being used

## Technical Governance

### Architecture Constraints
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Editor:** TipTap with academic extensions
- **State:** React hooks + Firestore real-time sync
- **AI:** Vercel AI SDK with multi-provider support
- **Export:** Client-side DOCX/PDF/LaTeX generation

### Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode required
- No `any` types in production code
- All components must be accessible (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark mode support mandatory

### Security Requirements
- Firebase Authentication required for write operations
- API keys never exposed to client
- Rate limiting on all external API calls
- Input sanitization before database writes

---

## Development Process

### Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
1. **Specify** requirements before implementation
2. **Plan** architecture with consideration for all disciplines
3. **Implement** with tests and documentation
4. **Validate** against specification

### Change Management
- Breaking changes require spec update
- New disciplines require prompt review
- Database integrations require rate limit analysis
- All AI prompts require academic review

## Stakeholder Priorities

### Primary Users
1. Graduate students writing theses/dissertations
2. Researchers writing journal articles
3. Faculty writing grant proposals
4. Clinicians writing case reports

### Secondary Users
1. Undergraduate students learning academic writing
2. Science communicators writing for public audiences
3. Industry researchers writing technical reports

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Never fabricate citations** - All references must come from real, verified sources
2. **Never claim AI writing is human** - Transparency about AI assistance
3. **Never compromise user data** - Privacy and security are paramount
4. **Never lock users in** - Export and portability always available
5. **Never discriminate by discipline** - Equal quality across all fields
